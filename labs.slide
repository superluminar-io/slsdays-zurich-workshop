12 Apr 2019

superluminar.io

* Lab 0 - Form teams

- Form teams of 2-3.
- For each lab write down key questions (max 2!).
- Stick them to the wall.
- We'll go through the questions after each lab.


* Lab 1

.link https://go-serverless-workshop.com


- Bootstrap SAM app
- Build and deploy the app
- Run / invoke the functions

* Lab 2

- Modify the `hello-world` function to accept a `name` parameter and respond with a greeting
- Create some log messages
- Find out how to display log messages

* Lab 3

Implement a URL shortener using `DynamoDB` for storage with two functions.

- One function to create shortened URLs

 curl -v -XPOST -d url=https://zurich.serverlessdays.io https://$ENDPOINT/create-url

 > POST /create-url HTTP/1.1
 < HTTP/1.1 Created 201
 Created short url: http://$ENDPOINT/${short-url}

- One function to retrieve and redirect to the shortened URL

 curl -v http://$ENDPOINT/${short-url}

 > GET /${short-url} HTTP/1.1
 < HTTP/1.1 302 Found
 < Location: https://zurich.serverlessdays.io

* Things you'll need

- Use the `aws-sdk-go` package to talk to DynamoDB
- Create a DynamoDB table using CloudFormation
- Give your Lambda functions permissions to access the DynamoDB table with IAM
- Inject the DynamoDB table via environment variables
- Use path parameters with API Gateway and Lambda

* Using DynamoDB via the aws-sdk-go
 import (
 	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
 	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
 	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/dynamodb"
 )
.code ./slsdays-zurich/create-url/main.go 48,61

* Creating a DynamoDB table with Cloudformation

`serverless.yml` supports arbitrary Cloudformation resources under the `resources` key.

 resources:
   Resources:
     DynamoDBTable:
       Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
       Properties:
         TableName: url-shortener
         KeySchema:
           - AttributeName: "id"
             KeyType: "HASH"
         ProvisionedThroughput:
           ReadCapacityUnits: "1"
           WriteCapacityUnits: "1"
         AttributeDefinitions:
           - AttributeName: "id"
             AttributeType: "S"

* Give your Lambda functions permissions to access DynamoDB
- Every AWS Lambda function needs permission to interact with other AWS infrastructure resources
- Permissions are set via an AWS IAM Role which is automatically created and is shared by all of your functions
- You can set additional permissions via the `serverless.yml` file

 provider:
   iamRoleStatements:
     -  Effect: "Allow"
        Action:
          - "dynamodb:PutItem"
          - "dynamodb:GetItem"
        Resource:
          Fn::GetAtt:
            - DynamoDBTable
            - Arn

* Inject the DynamoDB table via environment variables

 provider:
   environment:
     DYNAMO_DB_TABLE:
       Ref: DynamoDBTable # References resource by name

 resources:
   Resources:
     DynamoDBTable:
       Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table

* Configure path parameters for your function

 get-url:
   handler: bin/get-url
   events:
     - http:
         path: /{short_url}
         method: get
         request:
           parameters:
             paths:
               short_url: true

* Lab 4

- Write a unit test to mock out AWS dependencies
- Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock` (or what ever framework you prefer)
- Test what happens when your handler can't find the short url in your storage

* Lab 5

- Create a new function
- Create a new table
- Hook up the function to the DynamoDB stream of the url-shortener table
- Fetch preview using e.g. https://github.com/badoux/goscraper
- Save the preview to the new table


* Lab 6

- Install and activate the tracing plugin
- Give IAM permissions to your function to use X-Ray
- Instrument your code (use version > v1.0.0-rc.1 of `github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-go`)
- Generate some traces by calling your function
- Checkout your traces using the AWS Console
